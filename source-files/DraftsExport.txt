**Quote** 2025-04-07

> _**Using Al effectively is now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify**. It's a tool of all trades today, and will only grow in importance. Frankly, I don't think it's feasible to opt out of learning the skill of applying Al in your craft; you are welcome to try, but I want to be honest I cannot see this working out today, and definitely not tomorrow. Stagnation is almost certain, and stagnation is slow-motion failure. If you're not climbing, you're sliding [...]   
  
**We will add Al usage questions to our performance and peer review questionnaire**. Learning to use Al well is an unobvious skill. My sense is that a lot of people give up after writing a prompt and not getting the ideal thing back immediately. Learning to prompt and load context is important, and getting peers to provide feedback on how this is going will be valuable._

AI is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers. Jan 24, 2025. A couple of days ago, Cursor went down during the ... 

The article "AI is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers" presents several key insights regarding the impact of AI on programming skills:

- **Dependency on AI**: Developers are increasingly relying on AI tools, leading to a decline in their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.
- **Neglect of Documentation**: Many programmers have stopped reading documentation, opting instead for instant explanations from AI.
- **Reduced Debugging Skills**: The ease of obtaining solutions from AI has diminished the ability to debug effectively, with many developers bypassing error messages entirely.
- **Loss of Deep Understanding**: Instant solutions from AI replace the learning experience that comes from grappling with coding challenges, resulting in superficial knowledge.
- **Emotional Frustration**: The reliance on AI has shifted the emotional experience of programming, where developers now feel frustration when AI does not provide quick solutions.
- **AI's Role in Development**: While AI can enhance productivity, it may also contribute to a lack of genuine programming skills among developers.
- **No-AI Days**: The author proposes implementing "No-AI Days" to encourage developers to engage deeply with their work, such as reading error messages and writing code from scratch.
- **Rules for AI Usage**: Suggestions include understanding problems independently before consulting AI, reading AI-suggested solutions thoroughly, and focusing on learning patterns rather than just immediate fixes.
- **Concerns for New Programmers**: New developers may miss out on the satisfaction and understanding that comes from solving problems independently, leading to a generation that can query AI but lacks fundamental skills.
- **Future Implications**: As AI capabilities improve, the concern is not about AI replacing programmers but rather the potential self-replacement of programmers who become too dependent on AI tools.

# Computing inside an AI | Will Whitney

> What would it mean to treat AI as a tool instead of a person?

> I propose a new mode of interaction, where models play the role of computer (e.g. phone) applications: providing a graphical interface, interpreting user inputs, and updating their state. In this mode, instead of being an “agent” that uses a computer on behalf of the human, AI can provide a richer and more powerful computing environment for us to use.
